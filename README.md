# bluebutton-openapi3
CMS Blue Button 2.0 API expressed as an OpenAPI3.0 definition document built using Swagger-Editor 

These files can be loaded into swagger-editor. 

NOTE: OpenAPI3 supports the OAuth2 security scheme but tthe Swagger Editor does not implement the OAuth2.0 workflow. 
Therefore the intteractive API client does not enable an OAuth2.0 flow for accessing secured resources. 
This would require a custom plugin for the swagger-editor.

To edit this file load the openapi.yaml file into swagger hub or install swagger-editor and run locally.
